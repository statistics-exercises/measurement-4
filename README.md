# Bubble volumes

Let's suppose that we are interested in the distribution of the volumes of the bubbles rather than the distribution of their radii.  As the bubbles are spherical we can calculate the volume, V, of a bubble from the radius, R, using:

__Use this formula to generate a plot of the volumes of the bubbles like the plot of radii of the bubbles that you created in the first task__.  The x-coordinates of the points should just be the integers starting at 0 and finishing at 199.  The y-coordinates will be the bubble volumes which you should calculate from the radii that were read into the NumPy array called `radii` from the file called `bubbles.dat`.
